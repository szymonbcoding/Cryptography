To run this code you need two arguments:
1. mode: encryption (if you want to code your sequence), decryption (if you want to decode your sequence) or test (if you want to check correctness of process of coding and decoding).
2. text: any sequence of characters you want to operate on (put it in quotes).

For example: 
python morse.py encryption "pyry z gzikiem"
